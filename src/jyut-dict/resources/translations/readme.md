## Notes on translations

- After doing `lupdate`, please paste the contents of `macmenu-zh_Hans` or `macmenu-zh_Hant` at the top of the simplified/traditional files. This is because lupdate does not recognize "MAC_APPLICATION_MENU" as being a valid context, and marks all of the previous translations as 'vanished'.
