READINGS are Jyutping readings for items already in CEDICT
CC_CANTO is Cantonese-specific entries

CC-CANTO and READINGS use the full-width comma (ï¼Œ) instead of the normal comma (,), and do not add a space after the full-width comma. This conflicts with the CC-CEDICT standard, so it is probably a good idea to do a find-and-replace for those characters.
